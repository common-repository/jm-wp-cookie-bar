**How to style it?**

There are already some basic style but you can override them. Just use the following css classes : `.cookie-message`, `.cookie-message a`, `.cookie-message` p, `.wpcb-close-btn` for the button but you can even change the button class (option), and `.cookie-rules` for the link to your cookies rules page.

You can even deactivate basic style and style it entirely in your main stylesheet.
